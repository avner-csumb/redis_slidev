## What is Redis?

<br>

### **RE**mote **DI**ctionary **S**erver

<!-- Redis is the archetype of in-memory key‚Äìvalue stores. -->

- An open-source, in-memory, single-threaded "data structure store"
  - allows for the storage and retrieval of data structures, such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, and more
  - speedy --- micro-seconds vs. the milli-seconds we're used to with disk-based stores.
- Known for its high performance, scalability, and versatility
- Virtually every production system uses Redis (or an equivalent) for caching, sessions, rate-limiting, real-time messaging, and lightweight queues.
  - A staple of "database adjacencies."
<!-- - Redis's persistence modes (RDB snapshots vs. AOF logs) highlight trade-offs between durability, performance, and recovery  -->
<!-- - Powerful Pub/Sub mechanism -->

## History

<br>

- 2009 - Salvatore Sanfilippo, an Italian developer, found that MySQL could not provide the necessary performance for real-time web analytics
- Went from a small personal project from Sanfilippo, to being an industry standard for in-memory data storage.

## Comparison to SQL

<br>

| Aspect         | SQL Databases                                       | Redis                                                  |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Data Model     | Relational model with structured tables              | NoSQL key-value store with support for multiple data structures (e.g., lists, sets, hashes, streams) |
| Storage        | Disk-based storage with caching layers for performance | In-memory storage for speed, with optional disk persistence (RDB, AOF) |
| Query Language | Uses SQL (Structured Query Language)                 | Uses its own command set (e.g., GET, SET, HGETALL); no SQL |
| Use Cases      | Structured data, complex queries, transactional integrity, relational models | Caching, real-time analytics, messaging, fast-access scenarios |

## Where Traditional RDBMSs Struggle (1 of 5)

<br>

**Hot-Read Caching**
- A small subset of data ("hot keys" or documents) is read far more often (10x - 100x) than the rest.
- Every cache-miss triggers planner, optimizer, disk I/O (~1‚Äì3 ms each)

<br> 

**With Redis:**
- `GET user:1234` always sub-millisecond
- Built-in "Least Recently Used" (LRU) eviction, no extra query planning

---

## Where Traditional RDBMSs Struggle (2 of 5)

<br>

**High-Frequency Counters & Concurrency**
- Atomic `UPDATE ‚Ä¶ SET counter = counter + 1` at very high queries per second (QPS)
- Row-level locks slow things down under heavy load.
- WAL/journaling thrash + autovacuum bloat slow sustained writes

<br> 

**With Redis:**
- `INCR page:view:5678` is lock-free & `O(1)`

---

## Where Traditional RDBMSs Struggle (3 of 5)

<br>

**Ephemeral State & Session Management**
- Short-lived data (sessions, feature-flags, temp locks) that expires on its own.
- Frequent `INSERT`/`DELETE` churn, index maintenance
- Table bloat ‚Üí expensive `VACUUM`, fragmentation

<br> 

**With Redis:**
- Keys with `TTL` auto-expire; no background `GC`
- In-memory list, set, hash structures for fast lookups

---

## Where Traditional RDBMSs Struggle (4 of 5)

<br>

**Event Streaming & Pub/Sub**

- On-disk queues or tailable cursors lack true ordering & replay
- Notifications don‚Äôt scale to many consumers
- No built-in consumer groups or at-least-once delivery guarantees

<br> 

**With Redis:**
Redis Streams + consumer-groups for ordered, replayable log


---

## Where Traditional RDBMSs Struggle (5 of 5)

<br>

**Heavy Analytical & Batch Workloads**
- Large scans, complex joins or aggregations, real-time analytics.
- Long-running queries lock resources, contend with OLTP traffic, and can overwhelm primary nodes.

<br> 

**With Redis:**
- Can use RedisTimeSeries or Lua scripts for near-real-time stats

<br>

## Threading

- Redis is a single threaded process and will, at most, consume two cores if you have persistence enabled. -->

---

## Core Data Structures  

<br>

Redis supports five different data structures: strings, hashes, lists, sets and ordered sets --- regardless of the type, a value is accessed by a key. 

- **String**: arbitrary byte values  
- **Hash**: maps of fields ‚Üí values  
- **List**: ordered collections  
- **Set**: unique, unordered collections  
- **Sorted Set**: scored, ordered collections  

---

| Data type | Canonical commands | Typical use |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| **String** | `SET/GET/INCRBY` | Counters, flags |
| **Hash** | `HSET/HGETALL` | User profiles |
| **List** | `RPUSH/LRANGE` | Log buffers, task queues |
| **Set** | `SADD/SMEMBERS` | Unique tags |
| **Sorted Set** | `ZADD/ZRANGE` | Leaderboards, feeds |
| **Streams** | `XADD/XREAD` | Append-only event logs |

---

## Hands-on: Basic Commands

<br>

1. **Strings & counters**

```bash
SET page_views 0
INCRBY page_views 42
GET page_views   # 42
```

<br>

2. **Lists**

```bash
RPUSH recent_log "user123 signup" "user123 click"
LRANGE recent_log 0 -1
```

---

## Hands-on: Basic Commands (cont.)

<br>

3. **Sets & membership**

```bash
SADD online_users u1 u2 u3
SCARD online_users
SISMEMBER online_users u2
```
<br>

4. **Pub/Sub teaser**

```bash
SUBSCRIBE classroom
# in another shell
PUBLISH classroom "Hello CST 363"
```

## Redis + PostgreSQL ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•

<br>  

-  **Read-through cache**  
  - Flask route hits Redis ‚Üí miss triggers Postgres query ‚Üí result cached with TTL.  
- **Write-behind / event sourcing**  
  - App writes to Redis **Stream**; separate worker persists to Postgres asynchronously.  
- **Real-time counters**  
  - `INCR` in Redis, nightly ETL to Postgres for durable analytics.  
- **Pub/Sub fan-out** for web-socket notifications while Postgres stays source of truth.
  - Publisher sends one message to a channel 
  - Redis instantly "fans out" (copies) that message to every active subscriber on that channel.

## NBA Play-by-Play App

**Real-time streaming + durable storage**

<!-- ![](/nba.png){width=400px lazy} -->


<!-- ## Goals & Features   -->

- "Pretend live" multi-game replay of NBA play-by-play  

- Accelerated or real-time playback via `SIM_SPEED`  

- **Redis** for low-latency fan-out & caching  

- **Postgres** for durable event logging  

- Browser dashboard via Flask + Server-Sent Events

---

## Data Ingestion & Scheduling

<br>

1. **Read CSV** (`pbp2023.csv`) into Pandas 

2. **Filter** to a few games on a certain date (here 2023-03-24) 

3. **Compute** `elapsed_seconds` per event: 
   ```python
   elapsed = minutes*60 + seconds + periods_before*period_length
   ```  

4. **Seed a min-heap** with each game‚Äôs first event 
   ```python
   heap = [(elapsed0, game_id, idx0, events0), ...]
   ```


---

## Real-time Replay Loop 

<br>

- **Pop** next event from heap ‚Üí `(sim_t, gid, idx, evts)`  

- **Sleep** until `(sim_t / SIM_SPEED)` matches wall-clock  

- **Publish** payload ‚Üí Redis pub/sub + cache  

- **Batch** payload ‚Üí Postgres `INSERT ... executemany`  

- **Push** next event of that game back onto heap  

- Repeat until heap is empty

---

## Redis: Real-time Layer  

<br>

- **Pub/Sub**  
  - `r.publish("pbp_live", payload_json)`  
  - Flask SSE subscribes ‚Üí pushes to browsers  

- **Cache**  
  - `r.set("game:{id}:latest", payload_json, ex=120)`  
  - Quick lookup of current score/state


---

## Postgres: Durable Log  

<br>

- Table `pbp(ts timestamptz, game_id text, ...)`  
- Batched writes (`200` events per COMMIT)  
- Index on `(game_id, ts)` for fast history queries  
- Enables audit, replay, analytics after the demo

---

## Flask + SSE Front-End  

<br>

- **`/`** ‚Üí renders Bootstrap dashboard  
- **`/events`** ‚Üí SSE endpoint using `redis.pubsub().listen()`  
- Browser JS:  
  ```js
  const es = new EventSource("/events");
  es.onmessage = ev => { ... }
  ```  
- Updates:  
  - Scoreboard cards per game  
  - Live feed list (last 100 plays)

---

## Why This Architecture?  

<br>

| Concern            | Tool      | Role                                  |
|--------------------|-----------|---------------------------------------|
| Real-time updates  | Redis     | Pub/Sub & in-memory cache             |
| Durable persistence| Postgres  | Batched event store                   |
| Simple streaming   | SSE       | Server-Sent Events ‚Üí browser `EventSource` |
| Merge multiple feeds | Heap     | Time-ordered ‚Äúlive‚Äù event scheduling  |


---

## Possible Enhancements  

<br>

- **Scale fan-out**: Redis Streams, Kafka, or WebSockets  
- **Async I/O**: FastAPI/Quart + async Redis client  
- **Historical API**: add `/history?game_id=` querying Postgres  
- **Schema enhancements**: numeric time fields, PKs, constraints  
- **Simplify demo**: flatten+sort or `heapq.merge` for static CSV
